Which technology is trending now?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a trending technology that takes first place in the list of top 10 latest technologies in computer science of 2021. 
AI technology involves machine intelligence, which is as smart and intelligent as the human brain and reacts like humans. The intriguing discoveries of AI 
seem unfanthomable. The new developments, discoveries, and inventions seem to have no end. Where will we be in the next 10 years? Will Artificial Intelligence take over?

AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech 
(such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla), automated decision-making and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).
As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.
For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.
